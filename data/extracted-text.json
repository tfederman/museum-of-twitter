Eventually the girls stormed off crying. It was\nterrible, one of the worst things I’ve ever seen, such a mass of sexism\nall at once.

We\nplayed for about forty minutes, and most of the songs were off\nIncesticide, so they didn’t recognize anything. We wound up playing the\nsecret noise song (‘Endless, Nameless’) that’s at the end of Nevermind,\nand because we were so in a rage and were just so pissed off about this\nwhole situation, that song and whole set were one of the greatest\nexperiences |’ve ever had.” (from Nirvana: The Chosen Rejects)\n\nMar 10, 2019 - 1:26 AM UTC\n@2 38 531 W226",

As someone\n\nmore interested in the philosophical debate, not the sociological\ndebate, | generally stay out of these discussions.\n\nHowever, if | had to speculate, I'd say that the reason libertarians are\nmostly men is that men are not as good as women at logical\nreasoning. This is not to say all men are not as good at logical\nreasoning as all women. It’s just to say that the logical-reasoning bell\ncurve for men is to the left of the logical-reasoning bell curve for\nwomen. This means that there simply are more men in the bottom\n10% of ability to logically reason, which accounts for their\noverrepresentation in libertarianism, a philosophy that is internally\nincoherent and operates mainly through tautology and begging the\n\nquestion on entitlement.\n\n© 392 111.423 ©013.3K 4) 41M ,\n\nsid § +f 6: @lilbabygandhi-10h\nIs there any solid evidence on the idea of a\nfemale superiority in logical reasoning?\n\n© 22 1 0 97 il 31K\n\n[=\n\nJames Medlock\n@jdcmedlock\n\nOne piece of evidence I've noticed is the\nrelative lack of female libertarians",
