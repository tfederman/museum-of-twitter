Tweet from early modern boy-actress (they/them) (@economeager):

ladies imagine this. it's 20 years from now. your husband still has not returned from the war. your new suitors have invaded your home and your son is useless at turfing them out. you're weaving a burial shroud so they can't marry you. one day an old beggar arrives at the door.
