Nathan Fielder invited me to an unforgettable luncheon at his house but gave me bad directions, then after promising a roast and steamed clams, he served me hamburgers, which he called steamed hams, that were quite similar to the ones they serve at Krusty Burger. worse still, he had somehow successfully localized aurora borealis, the northern lights, entirely within his â€” and wouldn't even let me see it!
