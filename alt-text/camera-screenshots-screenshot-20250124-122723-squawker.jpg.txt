twin peaks is a really charming inconsistent fun tv show thats got some great highs but doesnt ever sustain them. twin peaks the return is the absolute best thing thats ever been on the television. but you have to watch all of twin peaks to get it

If you can't enjoy Twin Peaks at its Civil War LARP PTSD arc then you don't deserve it at its ethereal wooshing black and white nuclear test site flashbacks.
