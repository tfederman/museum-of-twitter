turkish language has a gossip tense. if you haven't witnessed an event yourself, you use gossip tense to emphasize that what you say may not be accurate, that it's hearsay. there's a cultural element too: if you use any other tense, people would judge you for misleading them.

i think it's a fantastic linguistic feature that lets you weigh the value of information conveyed to you. i wish all languages had similar inherent features to separate opinions from facts. you can omit an "i think" but, not the whole tense of the sentence.

thank you for all you added. to summarize:

- the formal name is “reported speech” a kind of “evidentiality markers” in linguistics. i coined “gossip tense” as i think it describes its function better.

- no, it doesn’t turn turkish men gay unless you're one from the get go.

 - no, being able to imply hearsay in a language isn't equivalent to this. this isn’t optional: you either use it, or use a factual verb. no “unspecified” certainity.

- many languages have varying evidentiality features. some are even more intricate (have levels, types, etc.).

it's defined as a tense in turkish grammar (its contemporary name is "learned past tense’). not a mood, not a subjunctive. i find it close to present perfect tense of english.

but i'm no linguist, so, anyone who wants to take on turkish language consoritum, be my guest. :)
