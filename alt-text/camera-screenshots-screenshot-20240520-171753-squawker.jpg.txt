Imagine if Maximus was intentionally written to appeal to minority audiences who benefit from DEI. He's incompetent, ignorant and simplistic despite receiving some of the best education available to any wastelander. He's spiteful, selfish, and vengeful despite claiming to idolize his benefactor's noble cause (he actually just wants to inflict harm for his own satisfaction). Yet despite his craven ineptitude and being caught red handed in self-serving lies over and over and over again, he keeps being promoted and endowed with rewards wildly beyond his level of skill or understanding, which he then goes on to abuse in the same cycle of behavior. Itâ€™s like he was made to encompass the lived experience of those living with Imposter Syndrome due to being privileged by Diversity Equity and Inclusion hiring frameworks. Only those people don't feel guilt,
