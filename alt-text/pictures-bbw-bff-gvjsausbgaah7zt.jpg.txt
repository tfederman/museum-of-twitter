this is how full-grown adults talk about movies in the year 2024

They're kissing again.
Do we have to hear the kissing part?

The problem with sex scenes are two fold, firstly, they aren't justifiable in terms of the plot, and secondly in terms of emotions. They work great for the autistic who can't deduce character intentions, 
or those who want degeneracy validated by major studios.

"I want more sex in movies!!" = either someone who views them as a 1:1 analogue for real life or degenerate goblins who want to see famous people naked.
