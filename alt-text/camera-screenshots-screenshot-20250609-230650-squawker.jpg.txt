LinkedIn guy finds out about concepts like “friendship” and “hanging out”

Geoff Black @SactoGeoff - 19h

Longtime friend in his mid 50's hosted a "guys night" this past weekend. There was probably 50 guys there. Roasted a whole lamb, ribs on the smoker, tons of food and booze. My friend had nothing material to gain by hosting. He doesn't "sell" anything.

But he has always had a huge network and understands relationships very well. So why would he throw this party? Well, until this past couple years, his home was always a beehive of family and friends coming and going. Most of the family moved away,

2 kids left the house for school. He mentioned last year his big beautiful home was feeling empty. And that's why he threw that party. Simply to connect and make more friends. And it was pretty great. Some of the best conversations I've had all year.

Some say the best things in life are free. I say the best things in life are things you're invited to.
