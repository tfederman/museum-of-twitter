Someone is suing Twitch because women on it are too sexy. And here are the (NSFW) "harms" he describes.

I... have no words.

a. The Plaintiff had purchased a fleshlight previously which went largely unused, until Twitch. Mr. Estavillo began using this device while he watches female twitch streamers and often ends up chaffing his penis everyday with the device - making it extremely painful and constant which ends up causing redness and mild infections at the tip, (since the fleshlight is electrical and also vibrates). The plaintiff therefore often has to use Neosporin on his tip to prevent necrosis

b. The Plaintiff often stays up for hours staring at the breasts of girl streamers, which ends up damaging his retina and making his eyes blood shot for days; eye drops do nothing to hide his shame from his parents and he is often questioned by people he comes into contact with as to why his eyes are so bloodshot and red - which leads to further embarrassment and isolation

c. The Plaintiff once ejaculated on his PC monitor, causing a short circuit and small fire within the electrical system of his gaming rig and causing his apartment to black out temporarily
