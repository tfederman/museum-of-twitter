There's a new trend in China where people make and eat spiceless "white people lunch’, as form of self torture.

And their commentary has me crying

“Lunch of Suffering”

However, many other netizens did not find the meals appetizing, noting that they lacked flavor and took away the joy of eating.

“The point of the white people’s meal is to learn what it feels like to be dead, but I’ve taken two bites and it was so bad it made me realize how alive I am,” a Weibo user wrote.
