Dudes can literally just sit around and name old sports players and just have the best time.

Decades of gender/sexuality research tell us this is a “dude” thing because some men still don’t have social permission to create direct bonds with other men; those bonds have to be indirect through sports talk, women, etc, which is one of many ways heteropatriarchy hurts men too
