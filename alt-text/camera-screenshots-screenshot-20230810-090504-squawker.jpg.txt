Lol an archaeology website had a Al write an article on the scimitar and they accidentally scraped a Dungeons and Dragons description.

Known to Europeans as the scimitar, the shamshir is the quintessential long sword of the horsemen of Persia (Iran), Moghul India, and Arabia. It scales primarily with Strength and Dexterity and is a good Weapon for high-dexterity characters who can excel at slashing attacks while spinning. A curved sword with a thin blade of ample length. Light of weight despite its larger size, its slicing attacks come in rapid succession. Such sabers were renowned for their sharpness and lethality.
